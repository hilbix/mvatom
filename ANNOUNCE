Nothing changed in mvatom, but dirlist now is a separate package.

This can be considered a bugfix, though,
as previously 'dirlist -rp .' did not work correctly.

If you wonder where version 0.5.0 is: It is not there for the moment.
So mvatom still operates in unsafe mode!  Please keep that in mind.
