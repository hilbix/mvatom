This script is for lazy experienced sysadmins and comes with mvatom:
http://www.scylla-charybdis.com/tool.php?tool=mvatom

This script removes files from the first directory which match files
in the second directory.  It checks softlinks, too.  Be sure that the
directory to delete is quiescent, this is, nobody else modifies files
or changes anything.  Also never run two of this scripts in parallel
on the same directory, you have been warned!

If this script fails have a look in the tempdir created, there are two
entries, "file" and "location".  Location tells you where file came
from.  Move it back manually.  (No warranty.  Use at own risk.  etc.)
