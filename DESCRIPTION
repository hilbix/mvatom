Move files by atomic rename instead of copy (like /bin/mv does).

/bin/mv might copy files across filesystems, which is not an atomic
operation.  This here only uses atomic variant.

Also it tries to avoid to overwrite things,
provides convenient features like
"rename away existing destinations"
or shell pipe support to move a mass of files.
