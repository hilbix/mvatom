Move files atomically.

Since version 0.5.0, on supported platforms,
it tries to be safe to never override things,
even not on weird and most awful situations.

Supported platforms currently is Linux (all
platforms, which implement `replaceat2()`).

Notes:

`mvatom` does not move across device boundaries on purpose!

To move across device boundaries, first do a copy followed by
a compare/remove cycle.  This is and will never be implemented
into mvatom!

To improve the compare/remove cycle, there is a helper script
to compare and remove whole directory trees:

	cmpanddel.sh

It is meant to be safe even against the weirdest situation like
accidentally try to compare a directory on itself due to an
unrecognized circular mount.

Formerly "dirlist" was part of this here, but it now is separate.
With dirlist, you can move directory trees which do not fit on
commandline, for example safely move all 'DIRa/*' into 'DIRb':

	dirlist -0p "$DIRa" | mvatom -0d "$DIRb" -

Please note that dirlist often is much faster than find,
because it can skip the "stat()" call when it does not need
to recurse, like in this case.
